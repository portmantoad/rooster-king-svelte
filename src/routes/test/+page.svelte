<div>Dedicated to Isabel Rivera Hernández, a Spanish woman whose death went unnoticed for 15 years because she was still paying her bills on autopay, mummifying in her bathtub in the middle of a crowded apartment complex 1. My friend’s dad was pretending to purchase an island He told the seller he needed to try it on for size He borrowed a boat and brought six middle school boys to camp A killer whale named Luna kept swimming up to us driving away the fish he must have been lonely. I resisted pressing my hand against his thick slick skin as a boat full of sightseers snapped pictures of us on disposable cameras Only me and one other boy wanted to fish again the next day The others planned to collect sticks and explore. We left our friends in their tents and set out towards the lighthouse. Our chaperone slept alone on the floor below as we laid in sleeping bags side by side whispering, staring into each other I wanted to kiss him. When I got up to use the bathroom I thought I saw a look flash across his face. When I returned he was asleep. It wasn't until the ride home that I heard the family dog had been run over. When I was in college I learned that Luna died too, caught in the motor of some other boat. 2. When I first moved to the city I was scared of the cars I had a basement suite, bus pass and $150 left for everything else each month. I got so lonely that I hung out in the library all day. I mostly ate potatoes. I was 17 years old One day I stood by the side of the tracks and thought of the skytrain barreling over me, crushing my bones and spreading my gore along the rails like raspberry jam over toast. I tiptoed to the edge just to see how close I could get. an alarm rang out and the train stopped cold, I jumped back.</div>
